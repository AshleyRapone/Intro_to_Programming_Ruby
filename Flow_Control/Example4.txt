#What will each block of code below print to the screen?

1. '4' == 4 ? puts("TRUE") : puts("FALSE")

2. x = 2
   if ((x * 3) / 2) == (4 + 4 - x - 3)
     puts "Did you get it right?"
   else
     puts "Did you?"
   end

3. y = 9
   x = 10
   if (x + 1) <= (y)
     puts "Alright."
   elsif (x + 1) >= (y)
     puts "Alright now!"
   elsif (y + 1) == x
     puts "ALRIGHT NOW!"
   else
     puts "Alrighty!"
   end


  1. False = statement is not true so you pick statement on the right side of the colon
  2. "Did you get it right?"
  3. "Alright now!" = even though the one after it is true the computer will stop at the first one that is correct
